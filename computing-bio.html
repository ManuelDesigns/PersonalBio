      -My history on the computer is actually very massive, main reason I
      would say is because of gaming. If it wasn’t for me spending countless
      of hours on my PS3 and Youtube, I probably wouldn't be here honestly I
      developed my life around it made a wild journey such as by learning
      Photoshop for graphic design using youtube tutorials from having the
      curiosity of having a Youtube channel for gaming which then lead me to
      admire how some of the artwork of some youtubers backgrounds and
      previously in middle school I was more amazed because it, youtube would
      let you have full control of the background except text layout. Even then
      it brought amazing “bg’s”(which was slang for backgrounds) to the
      community of call of duty I mostly remember watching so then I figured
      that I would need a background for my channel so then I search and found
      website, templates,  and other software but then I decided to learn how
      to create my own and Photoshop was the most official and popular method.
      Which then by 1000hrs of simple background tutorials and artistic
      experimentation you would think I should be some sort of internet addict
      or something close of that nature but no I was just a 13 year-old boy who
      found something bigger than life just by my curiosity.
