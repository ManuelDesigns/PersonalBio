 -My name is Manuel Paniagua, I am from Chicago although i mostly grew up in LA <br>
 and for the last four years of highschool i lived in a town called Lake Elsinore.<br>
One of the most important thing to know about me is that I’m really into Art.<br>
Skateboarding and soccer are my two go to activity when I want to exercise,<br>
 although I mostly like making films, taking photos, and messing around with<br>
  making music or anything creative as well related with clothing .<br>
 It’s funny because of all the previous activities, it all lead me to one thing<br>
 and probably my favorite of them all is the use of a computer.<br>
I also happen to enjoy great food. <br>
